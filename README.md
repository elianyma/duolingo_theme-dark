# Duolingo Dark Theme

<b>Hi!</b> 👋🏽

I started this little plugin because there is no official dark theme on the Duolingo website. This theme uses some of the colors from the Duolingo app's own dark theme, so you will feel familiar and comfortable. ✨
This theme is only in its infancy but will be updated over time. 🎨
